    -   We can change background color of element using CSS background-color property.
        Set it to the color name or code we want and place it inside a  style attribute.
        Then add this style attribute to an HTML element. ex. h1 {background-color: coral;}

7. How can image repetition of the backup be controlled?
    -   To control the repetition of an image in the background, use the background-repeat property.
        we can use no-repeat value for the background-repeat property if you do not want to repeat an image,
        in this case, the image will display only once.
        Ex. background-repeat:no-repeat;

    - The background-position property sets the starting position of a background image.
      Using background-position property we can move the background image horizontally and vertically.

10. Why should background and color be used as separate properties?
    - The background-color property in css is used to specify the background color of an Element. On the other hand,
      if you use only background property so you can either specify its valued as an image URL or as a color code. and
      if you use only color property so it will specify the text color of the selected element.
